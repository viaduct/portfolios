Conceptual Programming 
================================ 

Conceptual programming is a programming paradigm like procedual or 
object-oriented programming. This is introduced to make efficient programming 
code and documentation by removing duplication. 

In conceptual programming, everything is a concept. A concept is consist of 
data and operators. 
A data is an unit capable to identify multiple number of cases, 
or group of other data. For example, 
8bit is a data which can identify 256 number of cases. 
An operator is a definition of an operation which can be applied to one or 
more data of concept. Data derived from different types of concepts can be 
used in one operator. 

Compare to C programming language, data is like 
variable or struct, and operators are operators in C and functions modifying 
variables.
